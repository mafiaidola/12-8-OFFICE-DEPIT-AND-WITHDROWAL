The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Medical Management System from MVP to a more robust, feature-rich application. Key efforts included resolving critical UI/UX bugs, fixing API path inconsistencies, and implementing major features like comprehensive activity tracking and a unified financial system. Significant UI/UX overhahauls were performed across dashboards, navigation, clinic registration, and user management, shifting towards card-based, hierarchical displays and away from dropdowns. A major focus was ensuring data accuracy and real-time reflection from the backend to the frontend, particularly for activity logs, user statistics, and financial data. The work involved extensive refactoring, creating new components and API routes, and addressing security concerns like Mixed Content errors. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively working on enhancing the accounting system and fixing issues in Lines & Areas management, responding to detailed user requests for professionalism and data integrity.

The overarching goal is to establish a robust Medical Management System with integrated financial, visit, and enhanced clinic registration modules. The system must feature granular categorization, precise Google Maps integration with draggable pins, and comprehensive admin logs for clinic registration. Dashboards are required to provide role-specific, real-time data reflecting system activities and performance.

So far, the implemented features address:
- Core component loading issues for Visits, Activity Tracking, and Settings.
- System-wide GPS accuracy improvements for clinic registration and salesman location tracking in visits.
- A comprehensive UI/UX redesign, including a professional header, modern navigation, and interactive card-based interfaces for clinic classification.
- Resolution of Method Not Allowed errors, particularly for clinic registration API calls.
- Validation and strong database linkage for the financial system.
- An enhanced Visits Management module displaying real clinic data, auto-filling date/time, supporting clinic/credit categories, robust database linkage, role-based access, and salesman GPS tracking visible to admins. The UI for visits was further enhanced to use a hierarchical, card-based system, removing dropdowns for line/area/clinic selection, and providing a professional layout for visit types and priorities, including a request demo option.
- Improved Dashboard UI/UX, fixing Quick Actions, refining section alignment (Overall System Performance, System Usage Trends, Comprehensive Financial Overview, Recent System Activity Log).
- Sidebar and Header UI/UX fixes for empty space, overlap, and proper VIEW PROFILE button functionality with a comprehensive user profile modal.
- Branding update from Medical Management to EP Group with a new logo.
- Comprehensive Activity Tracking, recording login, clinic, visit, and order activities with salesman name, event, time, date, IP, device info, and Google Map location, linking to detailed sections, functioning as a heartbeat for the system with accurate and detailed logs.
- User Management section was enhanced to display users in rich, detailed cards with comprehensive information (contact, work, activity, permissions) and real-time statistics (sales, clinics added, visits, collections, debts) linked to the database, supporting professional detailed pages per user.
- A new, professional Accounting System was introduced with 5 tabs for financial management (invoices, debts, collections, reports, financial dashboard).

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive set of enhancements and bug fixes across multiple modules based on a detailed user request (Chat Message 181). The work was divided into phases.

The first phase, which has been completed, focused on developing a **Professional Accounting System**. This involved:
1.  **Backend Implementation**: Creation of  to handle all financial APIs (invoices, debts, collections, financial reports). These routes ensure that every financial operation is linked to real data in the database and that activities are logged.
2.  **Frontend Implementation**: Creation of . This component provides a multi-tabbed interface for the accounting system, including a financial dashboard with KPIs, invoice management (with print options), debt management, collection system with approval flows, and detailed financial reports per clinic.
3.  **Integration**: The new accounting system was integrated into the main  and registered in  and  for proper routing and display in the sidebar.

The second phase of the development has just begun, starting with fixing the **Lines & Areas Management** issue. The user reported that modifications to areas are not being applied. The engineer has initiated this by creating  and  to address this persistent bug, suggesting a full re-implementation or significant enhancement of the existing functionality.
