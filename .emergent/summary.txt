The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and enhanced the Medical Management System. Initial work focused on fixing critical component loading and Method Not Allowed errors, overhauling UI/UX (e.g., card-style clinic registration), and completing the financial system. The Visits Management module received a major update to display real clinic data and include salesman GPS tracking. The current trajectory shows the engineer resolving a persistent bug where the Create New Visit form wasn't showing clinics due to API path inconsistencies ( vs ). Subsequently, extensive UI/UX refinements were made to the dashboard layout, sidebar styling, Quick Actions button functionality, and user profile modal. Most recently, the engineer implemented a comprehensive activity tracking system on both backend and frontend, including recording login events, IP, device, and real-time location. The trajectory concludes with the engineer addressing Mixed Content Security Errors by ensuring all API calls use HTTPS and attempting to implement Content Security Policy, indicating the activity tracking feature is not fully visible/functional on the frontend due to this security issue.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a robust Medical Management System with unified financial, comprehensive visit, and Enhanced Clinic Registration modules. Clinic registration needs granular categorization, accurate Google Maps with draggable pins, and admin logs. Dashboards require role-specific, real-time data.

Implemented features include:
- Resolved error loading component for Visits, Activity Tracking, and Settings.
- Enhanced system-wide GPS accuracy for Clinic Registration and salesman location in Visits.
- UI/UX overhaul: Professional header, modern navigation, and interactive cards for clinic classification.
- Fixed Method Not Allowed errors, especially for clinic registration.
- Verified 100% correctness and database linkage of the financial system.
- Enhanced Visits Management: Form displays real registered clinics, removed dropdowns, auto-fills date/time, includes clinic/credit categories, robust database linkage, role-based viewing, and salesman GPS tracking visible to admin.
- Dashboard UI/UX: Fixed layout for Quick Actions, improved section alignment and professional styling (Overall System Performance, System Usage Trends, Comprehensive Financial Overview, Recent System Activity Log).
- Sidebar and Header UI/UX: Corrected empty space, sidebar overlap, and VIEW PROFILE button functionality with a comprehensive user profile modal.
- Branding: Changed Medical Management to EP Group with a professional logo.
- Comprehensive Activity Tracking: Implemented real-time recording of login, clinic, visit, and order activities with salesman name, event, time, date, IP, device info, and accurate Google Map location, linking to detailed sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user: the activity tracking system was not logging login events or geographical location, and the dashboard activity log was empty despite backend confirmation of activity recording.

The work sequence involved:
1.  **Backend Activity System**: The AI engineer first ensured the backend could record comprehensive activity data. New routes (, , , ) were added in  and integrated into . This ensures the backend properly stores login events, user IP addresses, device information, and geographical locations derived from the IP. Backend tests confirmed 100% success for these new APIs.
2.  **Frontend Integration of Activity Logging**: A new frontend service, , was created to centralize API calls for recording activities. The  function within  was modified to use this service, automatically recording user logins with detailed context (IP, device info, location) upon successful authentication.
3.  **Frontend Display Components Update**:  and  were updated to fetch and display this real, comprehensive activity data from the newly implemented backend APIs. These components were also registered in  and .

The immediate task being worked on is resolving a Mixed Content Security Error (loading HTTP resources over HTTPS) that surfaced during frontend testing of the newly enhanced activity tracking feature. The engineer has started systematically updating URLs in  and  to ensure they use HTTPS, and has initiated adding a Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag to  to prevent such errors.

The system is in a state where backend activity logging is confirmed functional, but the frontend display and full functionality of the activity tracking module are currently hindered by the Mixed Content Security Error.
